\block{Summary}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The proposed recognition system managed to detect all the 95 Euro banknotes in the 80 test images
		\item It was robust enough to handle folded and wrinkled banknotes with different kinds of illumination and perspective views
		\item The system is extensible to other banknote currencies and can also be used to detect planar objects besides banknotes
	\end{itemize}
